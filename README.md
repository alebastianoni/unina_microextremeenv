Introductory class in the Microbiology of Extreme Environments for graduate students pursuing a Master Degree in Biology of Extreme Environments. The class gives a recap of basic microbiology and microbial ecology concepts and then jumps into a more in depth analysis of the major extremophiles groups and extreme environments on Earth. The course is designed to provide general background in extremophiles to non-specialist coming from diverse subjects (Biology, Biotechnology, Natural Sciences, Environmental Sciences).

In the repository you'll find the different version of the class relative to each academic year. I always try to improve the class material year on year, so I suggest if interested to use the latest available year.
